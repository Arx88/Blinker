# Backend Structure

This rule describes the backend part of the project located in the `backend/` directory.

*   **Main directory:** `backend/`
*   **Key files/directories (Assumption - Please Verify/Update):**
    *   Entry point: Likely in `backend/main.py` or `backend/server.js` or similar.
    *   Configuration: Potentially in `backend/config/` or `backend/settings.py`.
    *   API Routes/Controllers: Maybe in `backend/routes/`, `backend/controllers/`, or `backend/api/`.
    *   Models/Database: Look for `backend/models/` or `backend/db/`.

Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/filename)` to link to specific files.
